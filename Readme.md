# Git crash course

This is a practical, no-BS crash course of git, the most-used version control system.

A version control system (VCS) manages a tree of files within a directory, versioning all changes to them,
so that the complete history is available:
once a version of a file is committed to a VCS it will never be lost and you can always get back to it.
This history kept by the VCS is called a repository (repo for short).

The course is organized by roles in which people might be using git.
The chapters are ordered by increasing complexity and responsibility of the role in git workflow.

1. [Browsing git repo](Browsing.md)
2. Contributing to git repo
3. Managing git repo
4. Creating git repo
